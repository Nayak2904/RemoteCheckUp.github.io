                     <p>Health care or healthcare is the improvement of health via the prevention, 
                        diagnosis, treatment, amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and 
                        other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by 
                        health professionals and allied health fields. Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, 
                        midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, 
                        physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions all constitute 
                        health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, 
                        and tertiary care, as well as in public health.
                        Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, 
                        influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies. 
                        Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health 
                        services to achieve the best possible health outcomes". Factors to consider in 
                        terms of health care access include financial limitations (such as insurance 
                        coverage), geographical and logistical barriers (such as additional 
                        transportation costs and the possibility to take paid time off work to use 
                        such services), sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations 
                        (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health 
                        literacy, low income).[4] Limitations to health care services affects 
                        negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and 
                        overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).
